===================

This is the source repository for the WATS1010 Introduction to Web Development
Advanced Markup assignment.

The purpose of this assignment is to practice additional markup techniques,
including presentation of tabular data in an accessible format, and the
HTML/CSS interaction required to make page layouts work to elegantly organize
and contain information.

Requirements
------------

In order to complete this assignment, you will need to write HTML and CSS to
create a page that matches the layout provided (``target_layout.png``). You
must also link all of the pages together successfully. 

This assignment requires:

1. Convert the table included in the PDF into an accessible data table in HTML
   and add that code to the correct place in the HTML file.
2. Create page layout styles to build the header, navigation, aside, content and
   footer areas as shown in ``target_layout.png``. (NOTE: You do NOT need to
   modify the HTML file aside from the area denoted for the data table.)
